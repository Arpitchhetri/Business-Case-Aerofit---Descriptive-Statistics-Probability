## 📊 Business Problem

Aerofit aims to understand customer behavior better and **recommend the right treadmill model** to new buyers.  
To achieve this, our project focuses on two main goals:

- **Descriptive Analytics:**  
  Create customer profiles for each treadmill type using tables, charts, and descriptive statistics. 📈📊  

- **Probability Analysis:**  
  Build two-way contingency tables and compute **conditional and marginal probabilities** to reveal patterns in customer behavior. 🤓📉
